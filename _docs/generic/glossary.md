**Monomorphic locus:** all individuals in a population carry the same allele

**Polymorphic locus:** individuals within a population carry different alleles (Segregating sites)

**Fixed differences:** sites that differ between species but are monomorphic within the species.

**synonymous fixed difference:** 

**non-synonymous fixed difference:**

**minor allele:** less common allele in a segregatting site within a population.

**major allele:** most common allele in a segregating site within a population.

**derived allele:** most recent allele in a polymorphism (segregating site).

**ancestral allele:** oldest allele in a polymorphism.
